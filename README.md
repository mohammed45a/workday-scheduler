# Workday Scheduler Challenge #

## Description
In this challenge, the task was to use jQuery to create a work day scheduler. The page shows today's date with a grid below. The grid displays times and sections. When you type out something in the text boxes and the save button is pressed, the text is saved to the local storage. Once it is a new day, the text will be wiped and a new day will start. It allowed me to utilise and practice with a recently learned skill. I found it difficult when trying to understand jQuery/JS but some self-help after the lessons helped out a lot. Still need to do some more work on understanding the basics of JS/jQuery more so it becomes familiar. 

## Installation
To install this, go to the repository located here https://github.com/mohammed45a/workday-scheduler. On the page, press the green code button and copy the repository using the https or ssh. Then open your terminal and go to your file/folder where you want to clone it. Write git clone on terminal then paste the link and the clone should copy to your local machine.
